1) Create repository on Github, make sure that pushing is working well. https://github.com/zigfi7/demoqa_zigtest
2) Push a script for simplified pushing ;) (one branch only)
3) Create python virtual environment venv, for system independency.
4) Setup file for installing libs.
5) Functions created to interfrace with bookstore interfrace on https://demoqa.com/
6) Creating semi-automatic test steps. 
	a) generate username and password 
	b) chcek if you can log in (should be false)
	c) register user
	d) generate authentication token
	e) use the token for interacting with a page
	f) add book
	g) add another book
	h) remove books from user
	i) delete user.

summary:
Script is interacting wirh a page correctly, but is not immune of response errors and random requests yet.
Log is generated on console including timestamps, with a second precision, what can be use in error locations.

The next steps will be improve requests, make it more clear regarding to potential issues, and add functionality for books adding and search.
